We are constantly approached by fellow investors who want to co-invest whereby taking advantage of our Theta Model, the proven de-risking tool we developed over the past 20 years.

The Theta Model enables us to de-risk and to integrate our fiduciary responsibilities with our ESG/UN PRI-oriented investment activities in order to achieve:

* A more efficient capital deployment with a better risk-return and integral impact profile
* 
A more rigorous integration of traditional investment expertise with Integral Investing know-how through the parity of people, planet, and profit
* 
A strong competitive edge and a significant differentiating factor through a strategic partnership
* 
Self-actualization through investing and your personal passion and purpose

For co-investment opportunities, we have created the AQAL AG
