Early September 2015, investors met with the Club of Rome to engage in a dialog about the "next forty years". Prof. Jørgen Randers, co-author of the original "Limits to Growth" and author of "2052: A Global Forecast for the Next Forty Years" gave the keynote speech. In the following panel, Dr. Mariana Bozesan (intern. full member Club of Rome, author of the Integral Investing model), moderated a discussion between Prof. Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker (Co-President Club of Rome), Prof. Klaus Töpfer (intern. full member of Club of Rome; Executive Director, IASS Potsdam), Jochen Wermuth (Impact Investor; Founder, Wermuth Asset Management).
